# SNHU-CS320
A repo for SNHU's CS 320 course

## Before taking this class, I had some notion of the importance of software testing. I had even written a few, very simple unit tests for some of my personal projects. But only when doing so was part of the curriculum, else, it would not have even been an after thought. Now that the course is nearing its end, I am happy to say that not only do I have a much greater appreciation for testing and debugging, but I am also more well-versed in its practice. This is part of how programmers ensure their code is roboust when it hits production.
# One way we can make sure the code we write is roboust is by ensuring it can handle the needs of its users. Ideally, programmers would get these in the form of requirements from the client, and in turn, translate this into code. There are several schools of thought as to how to tackle software development. Some hold testing off until the very end of the project, and perhaps only then, first discovering its bugs or errors. I think a more practical approach would be to incorporate testing at the start, whereby we write a bit of code, then write the tests to assess it. There are even some that will actually write the tests before the code itself is ever done.
